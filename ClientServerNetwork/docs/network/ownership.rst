Ownership
=======================================

All networked game objects are "owned" by an individual client.

Default Ownership
-----------------
TODO: Discuss how ownership is assigned to networked game objects as they are spawned, both from the client and server.


Ownership Transferring
----------------------
TODO: Discuss how and when ownership of game objects is transferred between various clients. Discuss why we would want to transfer ownership (as clients are leaving areas, disconnecting, or based on gameplay).
